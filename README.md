1. Fizz-Buzz Assignment (18Feb23)

2. Loop Challenges
    a. Print odds 1-20
        Using a loop write code that will console.log all of the odd values from 1 up to 20.

    b. Decreasing Multiples of 3
        Using a loop write code that will console.log all of the values that are evenly divisible by 3 from 100 down to 0.
    
    c. Print the sequence
        Using a loop write code that will console.log the values in this sequence 4, 2.5, 1, -0.5, -2, -3.5.

    d. Sigma
        Write code that will add all of the values from 1-100 onto some variable sum and at the end console.log the result 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100. We should get back 5050 at the end.

    e. Factorial
        Write code that will multiply all of the values from 1-12 onto some variable product and at the end console.log the result 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * 10 * 11 * 12. We should get back 479001600 at the end.

3. Array Challenges
    a. Always hungry
        - Write a function that is given an array and each time the value is "food" it should console log "yummy". If "food" was not present in the array console log "I'm hungry" once.

    b. High Pass Filter
        - Given an array and a value cutoff, return a new array containing only the values larger than cutoff.

    c. Better than average
        - Given an array of numbers return a count of how many of the numbers are larger than the average.

    d. Array Reverse
        - Write a function that will reverse the values an array and return them.

    e. Fibonacci Array
        - Fibonacci numbers have been studied for years and appear often in nature. Write a function that will return an array of Fibonacci numbers up to a given length n. Fibonacci numbers are calculated by adding the last two values in the sequence together. So if the 4th value is 2 and the 5th value is 3 then the next value in the sequence is 5.
